Here is my first post, getting the styling down. Sometime later I need to add filters and such for food / dev / whatever I decide to put here.

## List of sandbox project ideas

## Future plans for the site

This started out as a typical portfolio site, but as I go along with making it, it's becoming more of a general personal site to serve as my digital storage. Eventually in the future when RAM prices are within vision I may even store areas like my media archive in a local home lab. Gotta make money for that to happen though.
